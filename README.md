# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction App
## by Ruchit Sonawane

🔍 "Know your heart before it breaks."

This smart and interactive web app predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on key clinical and personal health indicators. Powered by machine learning, it offers an accessible tool for early risk assessment—just by entering a few health metrics.

🚀 What It Does
The app analyzes user input across several medically significant features to estimate the risk of heart disease. These inputs include:

🧓 Age

🚻 Sex

❤️ Chest Pain Type

🩺 Resting Blood Pressure (mm Hg)

🧪 Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)

🍬 Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl

🧠 Resting ECG Results

🏃 Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

🏋️ Exercise-Induced Angina

📈 Slope of ST Segment

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes
This app uses a trained machine learning model (KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.) on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to make predictions. It processes the provided inputs through a pre-fitted scaler and outputs the probability of heart disease risk in real-time.


## 👤 Who’s It For?
Anyone curious about their cardiovascular health! While not a replacement for a real diagnosis, it’s a helpful early warning tool for awareness and prevention.
